# Python Poetry Installer

[![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://python-poetry.org/badge/v0.json)](https://python-poetry.org/)

This repository contains Poetry's official installation script, installer source and
related hosting configuration.

The script is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and made available at
https://install.python-poetry.org/.

## Usage

Poetry provides a custom installer that will install `poetry` isolated
from the rest of your system.

### osx / linux / bashonwindows / Windows+MinGW install instructions

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### windows powershell install instructions

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

> If you have installed Python through the Microsoft Store, replace `py` with `python` in the command above.

**Warning**: The previous `get-poetry.py` installer is now deprecated, if you are currently using it
you should migrate to the new, supported, `install.python-poetry.org` installer.

The installer installs the `poetry` tool to Poetry's `bin` directory. This location depends on your system:

- `$HOME/.local/bin` for Unix
- `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` on Windows

If this directory is not on your `PATH`, you will need to add it manually
if you want to invoke Poetry with simply `poetry`.

Alternatively, you can use the full path to `poetry` to use it.

Once Poetry is installed you can execute the following:

```bash
poetry --version
```

If you see something like `Poetry (version 1.2.0)` then you are ready to use Poetry.
If you decide Poetry isn't your thing, you can completely remove it from your system
by running the installer again with the `--uninstall` option or by setting
the `POETRY_UNINSTALL` environment variable before executing the installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --uninstall
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_UNINSTALL=1 python3 -
```

By default, Poetry is installed into the user's platform-specific home directory.
If you wish to change this, you may define the `POETRY_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_HOME=/etc/poetry python3 -
```

If you want to install prerelease versions, you can do so by passing `--preview` option or by using the `POETRY_PREVIEW`
environment variable:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --preview
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_PREVIEW=1 python3 -
```

Similarly, if you want to install a specific version, you can use `--version` option or the `POETRY_VERSION`
environment variable:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --version 1.2.0
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | POETRY_VERSION=1.2.0 python3 -
```

You can also install Poetry for a `git` repository by using the `--git` option:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --git https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git@master
````

> **Note**: The installer does not support Python < 3.6.

## Known Issues

### Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, there are various issues that maybe caused due to how
various Python standard library components are packaged and configured. The following
details issues we are presently aware of, and potential workarounds.

> **Note:** This can also affect WSL users on Windows.

#### Installation Layout

If you encounter an error similar to the following, this might be due to
[pypa/virtualenv#2350](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/2350).

```console
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/root/.local/share/pypoetry/venv/bin/python'
```

You can work around this issue by setting the `DEB_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT` environment
variable to `deb` in order to emulate previously working behaviour.

```bash
export DEB_PYTHON_INSTALL_LAYOUT=deb
```

#### Missing `distutils` Module

In certain Debian/Ubuntu environments, you might encounter the following error message
in error logs (`poetry-installer-error-*.log`) provided when the installer fails.

```console
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.cmd'
```

This is probably due to [this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.10/+bug/1940705).
See also [pypa/get-pip#124](https://github.com/pypa/get-pip/issues/124).

The known workaround for this issue is to reinstall the `distutils` package provided by
the distribution.

```bash
apt-get install --reinstall python3-distutils
```

If you have installed a specific python version, eg: `3.10`, you might have to use the
package name `python3.10-distutils`.
